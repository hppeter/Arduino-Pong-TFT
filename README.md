 A simple implementation of Pong on the Arduino using a tft for output.
  
  I used Arduino IDE 1.6.12 from Arduino.CC
  
  Testet with 2.4" TFT 320x240 LCD Shield (8-bit parallel, ST7783) and SWTFT library 
  from http://www.smokeandwires.co.nz on Arduino UNO.  Should work with any other display which can work with 
  the Adafruit GFX Master library.
  
  Uno modified with additional soldered A6 and A7 lines, because all other pins are connected to TFT. If you can, you can use a Arduino MEGA, there are enough free IO lines.
  
  2 Paddle (10K) connected to 5V, GND and A6 (A7)
  
  1 Button connected to 5V and A5 (A5 pulldown with 10K to GND)
  
  1 optional Buzzer connected to GND and D11
  
  I soldered all wires directly to the Arduino board.
 
  In Menu
  Select options with Paddle 1 and Button.
  To start place paddle on "Start".
  In Game press Button for exit
  
  The complete game mounted under an acryl sheet. I used small stripes of double sided adhesive Tape to glue the TFT.

  Here you can see the additional soldered A6 and A7 lines. If you donÂ´t like
  this you can use an Arduino MEGA oder any other Arduino with enough I/O lines.
